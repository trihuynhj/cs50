## PICPRANKCS50
1. **Video Demo**: <https://youtu.be/QEzhvrqwjpQ>

2. **Description**:
    - Implementation: PicPrankCS50 is a simple web application built with Python (Flask framework) on the server side, HTML/CSS and some basic JavaScript on the client side. The program also utilizes the SerpAPI for Google Image Search engine, Python's SMTP library for sending email and some other minor libraries. Admittedly, I took the inspiration from Problem Set 9 (Finance) for the creation of this program. I utilized the MVC (Model-View-Controller) design pattern and some initialization code to get the program started, as I wanted to focus on the implementation of the core idea (which is explained below). I hope that it is not against the rule. Also, a big thank you to the CS50 Staff for their awesome and super-easy-to-use CS50 IDE, which comes with Python, HTML/CSS, JavaScript and also the useful SQLite. Without it, I could not have finished this project.
    - Functionality: PicPrankCS50 allows users to enter a search keyword and an email address. It will randomly choose an image from the results of the search and send it to the provided email address using its own email (picprank.cs50@gmail.com). Users will not use their own email account to send images (for security reasons), but will be asked to register for an account to use the service. Moreoever, as there is limit to the free plan of the SerpAPI services, each user will only be allowed 10 searches. After than, user will need to register for another account to continue using the service (no limit to the number of accounts one can register).

3. **Implementation Detail**:
    - application.py: This file contains all the code that sets up and controls behaviors of the program. It is implemented with the Flask framework (including Flask's Session for user registration, login/logout). I took the inspiration from Problem Set 9 (Finance) and reused some of its initialization code in this file. As the main part, it governs the functionality of all HTML pages (from the templates folder, detail for each page is explained below).
