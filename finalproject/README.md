1. **Video Demo**: <https://youtu.be/QEzhvrqwjpQ>

2. **Description**:
    - Implementation: PicPrankCS50 is a simple web application built with Python (Flask framework) on the server side, HTML/CSS and some basic JavaScript on the client side. The program also utilizes the SerpAPI for Google Image Search engine, Python's SMTP library for sending email and some other minor libraries. Admittedly, I took the inspiration from Problem Set 9 (Finance) for the creation of this program. I utilized the MVC (Model-View-Controller) design pattern and some initialization code to get the program started, as I wanted to focus on the implementation of the core idea (which is explained below). I hope that it is not against the rule. Also, a big thank you to the CS50 Staff for their awesome and super-easy-to-use CS50 IDE, which comes with Python, HTML/CSS, JavaScript and also the useful SQLite.
